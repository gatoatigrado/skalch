This project will be made private soon, but public (BSD license) releases will be created when work is ready.

=== Building ===

The java files can be built with Eclipse (.project files are version controlled). If your Eclipse doesn't automatically build, you can execute it through the Project / Build All item. If you need to clean files (particularly when pulling updates), try Project / Clean.

Currently, as fsc has given me plenty of headaches, scala files are built using a custom script. First, the plugin must be compiled. This can be done with

    >>> build_util/package_plugin.sh

to build all scala files, use

    >>> build_util/build.py fsc

=== Running ===

More options for running and compiling can be found by executing

    >>> build_util/build.py --help

The script should issue warnings if files aren't found. To add a location, add it to any environment variable, e.g. CLASSPATH (separated by your operating system's path sep, on unix ':')
