Project: Scala dynamic sketching
Institution: UC Berkeley ParLab
Authors: Nicholas Tung, Casey Rodarmor

=== Building ===

Building is now much cleaner, thanks to Maven! You do need to install (not just compile) the plugin so Maven can find the jar file. Note that installations are per-user, so you don't have to be root.

    >>> mvn install

=== Running ===

Aliases to run tests are contained in the Makefile; view them with

    >>> make help

=== Editing ===

BEFORE YOU EDIT: Please use Eclipse to edit all Java files. The Eclipse formatter should control _all_ formatting in _all_ java files. To get it set up,

    * Import project files with "Import / Existing projects into workspace".
        * Select the "skalch-base" subdirectory.
    * Right-click the project, go to properties
    * In "Java Code Style", "Enable project specific settings" should be checked.
    * In "Java Editor / Save Actions", "Enable project specific settings" should be checked.
