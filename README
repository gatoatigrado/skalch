Please see relevant documents in the "doc" folder (rendered into .pdf for every release),
    * software_documentation.lyx -- Software dependencies, commands to build the project

    * developing.lyx -- A guide to developing this compiler; it may contain relevant info for those only interested in graph transformations

For most questions, ask Nicholas. Below is a short list of contacts / credits. Note that some work may not be in the latest branches, to avoid compilation issues (as the APIs change).
